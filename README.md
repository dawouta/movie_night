There is an apk build in the bin folder 
- this has been tested for Android on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and S4 mini as well as a Samsung S

I have not compiled for iOS although I suspect that it should compile to and scale correctly on iOS without a problem

The app was built in Flash Builder 4.7 all .actionscript, .project and .settings files are included
